On my previous blog entries, I mentioned the amazing documentation that is available from Vuetify's Webpage (I said there was a lot of really cool stuff in there, and there really is). You can go ahead and take a look at all the different documentation by clicking [here.](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start/ "Vuetify Documentation")

As also mentioned in my last posts, I will be utilizing Visual Studio Code as my IDE of choice. You can go ahead and download that by clicking [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

In this post, I'll be highlighting some of benefits of creating a single-page application. Feel free to click on whichever section you'd like if you're interested!


In this post, I'll be explaining what a Single Page Application is, to the best of my abilities, as well as explaining the benefits of utilzing a Single Page Application over the traditional model. Lastly, I will be discussing the differences in different JavaScript Frameworks that will allow you to easily create a Single Page Application.

## **What is a Single Page Application?**

Okay, so this is where I had to refer to different sources to verify this information. To the best of my knowledge, a Single Page Application is exactly what is sounds like; an application that is built only utilizing one web-page. But, that isn't quite clear now is it?

Single Page Applications are web-applications that only load once within the web-browser (which again, I'm hoping is Google Chrome...). Instead of constantly having to reload the entire web-page, with Single Page Applications the web-page is only loaded once, and instead has its data and information dynamically changed (re-written, technically speaking) in order to load information quicker. All of the web application's necessary HTML, CSS and JavaScript code is loaded only once!



## **Why chose to build your site as a Single Page Application**

Now that we know that, you might be asking yourself "Well, what are the benefits of a Single Page Application? Why not stick with the good ol' fashion way?"

Below are two examples of different webpages, both loading the same content. But, one of them is a Single Page Application and the other is the good ol' reload eveything all over again approach.

If those two examples aren't convincing enough, below I've listed a few other reasons to go build your site as a Single Page Application:

- Your Webpage Will Feel Faster, and More Responsive
Since your webpage will only load once, its contents will in many occasions load rather quickly. This is achievable because of the nature of Single Page Applications, which dynamically change the content on the previousy loaded web-page instead of constantly re-loading entire web-pages.

- Your Website Will Feel like A Single Application
When users visit a website, there is a certain level of expectation in terms of functionality, ease of use and to a certain extend uniforminity. One of the benefits of utilizing a single-page application is that the website will feel as if it's a single native application. This in turn translates to a more tied-together website, increasing the ease of use and overall user experience.

- You'll be building with a JS Framework! (Hopefully)
While Utilizing a JS Framework such as Vue JS, Angular JS or React are great ways of building a Single Page Application, they are not the only ways to do it. However, they will siginificanly simplify the process of doing so. Additionally, and perhaps the most important of them all, you'd be learning a JS Framework of your choice! A JS Framework can make your web-page a much more intuitive experience than anything you've ever done before, and it's a skill that can definitley help you in the future!

## **Which Framework is best for you?**

Now, there are a wide variety of different JavaScript Frameworks that you can utilize. As you can probably already guess, the Framework of choice that I have gone ahead and utilized is Vue JS. You can learn more about Vue JS [here.](https://vuejs.org/) However, there are various other Frameworks that are quite popular, each of them with the backing of different organizations.

For instance, Angular JS is backed by companies such as Google (or how they'd like to say it, "super-powered by Google"). You can learn more about Angular JS [here.](https://vuejs.org/)

Addiionally there is also React JS, which has the backing of companies such as Facebook. You can learn more about React JS [here.](https://vuejs.org/)

That's it for this week's post. Thanks for reading!
